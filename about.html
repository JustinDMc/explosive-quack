        <h1>About</h1>
        <p class="about-words">As an individual who started playing video games on the 
            Nintendo 64, waking up on Sunday mornings to spend all day 
            battling my brothers on Super Smash, I have been in love with video games 
            ever since. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I do not intend for this website to be extremely serious or 
            as in-depth as a professional gaming website with analysis. This 
            is a place for me to explore why video-games meant what they did
            for me, and why certain ones were more fun than others.
            <br>
            <br>
            With that being said, I do hope that you look around and see my 
            thoughts on what games YOU love, and I would enjoy nothing more than
            beginning a conversation with you about any differences of opinion.
            <br>
            <br>
            Enjoy!
