          <h2 id="botw-criteria">Main Storyline: 9/10</h2> 

          <p>The main story of this game is for a reawakened (post 100 years) Link to free the Divine Beasts
                 from Calamity Ganon, and use their assistance alongside his refound Master Sword to help Zelda
                 rid the evil Ganon from the kingdom of Hyrule. </p>

          <p>Keep in mind that this is an entirely open-world game, meaning
                 you can head straight from the tutorial quests to the final boss. (good luck!)
                 However, the game highly incentivizes finishing the main quest, as each Divine Beast
                 gives Link a special ability and freeing all four beasts reduces the final boss total health by 50%.</p>

          <p>Perhaps my favorite feature of the main storyline is the location of the Divine Beasts.
                 Spread out across the four corners of Hyrule, completing the main quest is also an 
                 opportunity to see the beautiful world this game has to offer. Each Divine Beast is host to its own 
                 culture and region, introducing you the player to well-written characters and the core of this game - 
                 the charm. The interaction between Link and the characters in the story are full of life, humor, 
                 credible background and relentless optimism. It's just as enjoyable experiencing it on my fourth playthrough 
                 as it was on my first. </p>

          <p>The combination of the fresh, engaging characters and storyline along with not-indecent boss
                 challenges and some of the trickier puzzles in the game are what ranks this storyline so high.</p>

          <h2 id="botw-criteria">Side Quests: 10/10</h2>
          <p><em>-- In the context of this website, I will be counting the "shrines" in Breath of the Wild as part of the game's 
                 side quests, in addition to the several dozen actual side quests generated by various NPC's in the game. --</em></p>

          <p> What lands this game in my all-time favorites list is the side quests. It's what pulls me back to 
              this game so often. It's also what I believe gives the game the longevity it has; it continues to be a fan 
              favorite amongst the Legend of Zelda player base. </p>

          <p> Throughout the sprawling Kingdom of Hyrule you find yourself exploring, there are exactly 120 mini-dungeons called
                 "shrines." Each shrine presents Link with a puzzle or challenge that you must accomplish in order to complete the shrine,
                 and receive a "spirit orb" used to increase your stamina and amount of hearts. With the large amount of shrines, 
                 each one with a unique and thoughtful approach required to complete, the variety and excitement offered from the game is 
                 maintained almost incessantly. Some puzzles had me scratching my head in confusion, while others had me on the edge
                 of my seat hoping to sneak past an enemy or arrange certain objects just right. The shrines of this game, and exploring the 
                 vast world in order to find more, is undoubtedly my favorite part of this game.</p>

          <p>As if the 120 shrines you can complete weren't enough, hidden throughout the entire over-world of the game are <em>900</em>,
             yes I repeat <em>NINE HUNDRED</em>, secret items called Korok seeds. Not quite puzzles like the shrines are, attaining a Korok seed
              is more like beating a mini-game. Whether it be shooting a target from a long distance, chasing a sparkling ghost through a forest,
              or racing down a snowy mountain before time runs out, achieving all 900 of these bad-boys is a feat meant for only the most
              dedicated fans. <em>(I'm sitting at 560 myself, and consider myself a HUGE fan!)</em></p>

          <p>Mentioned previously, in addition to the outrageous number of shrines and Korok seeds, the NPC's in the game 
                 offer traditional side quests, ranging from gathering an amount of specific items, taking pictures of hard-to-reach monuments, or in 
                 very special circumstances building an entire town, they are tried-and-true, nothing too special but definitely enjoyable.</p>

          <p>The game offers a statistic on it's world-map screen that shows total completion of the game with a score out of 100%. Beating the main storyline,
                 completing all 120 shrines, and finding all 900 Korok seeds is what adds to that total percentage. This feat requres several dozen,
                 if not several hundred hours of gameplay, with every second of that being enjoyable.</p>

          <h2 id="botw-criteria">Effort vs. Return: 7/10</h2>

          <p>The reason that this game is getting an unamazing score on its "Effort vs. Return" is due mainly to the early-game and late-game progression.
                 The middle of the game, when every couple hours gives you noticable improvements to your heart-count and stamina wheel, feels extremely rewarding. However, during the early-game (especially in Master Mode), when your weapons are breaking
                 though your opponent has only 1/3 HP gone, and their HP begins regenerating while you scramble to find your next tree branch, the only way to
                 get stronger is by finding a stronger weapon. This can make progression feel more luck-based than effort-based. You could always brew ingredients together for various enchancements, but early-game you have
                 very limited access to anything worthwhile. In Master Mode, where a Silver Lynel spawns on the Great Plateau, the effort can feel slightly 
                 tilted out of your favor.</p>

          <p>In the end-game, and this is referencing more achieving the 100% completion goal, each Korok seed translates to maybe 0.08% progress. With some Korok
                 seeds requiring some pretty intense gameplay, the effort vs. return in these situations can also feel unbalanced. </p>
          
          <p>Overall, this game does feel rewarding. When you get the special abilities from freeing each Divine Beast, and you're finding new gear frequently,
                 and the shrines are easy to come by, you feel unstoppable. Getting that ball rolling, and maintaining it after the big bang showdown with Calamity Ganon
                 leaves slightly desiring. </p>
