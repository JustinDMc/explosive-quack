          <h2 id="botw-criteria">Main Storyline: 9/10</h2> 

          <p>The main story of this game is for a reawakened (post 100 years) Link to free the Divine Beasts
                 from Calamity Ganon, and use their assistance alongside his refound Master Sword to help Zelda
                 rid the evil Ganon from the kingdom of Hyrule.
          </p>

          <p>Keep in mind that this is an entirely open-world game, meaning
                 you can head straight from the tutorial quests to the final boss. (good luck!)
                 However, the game highly incentivizes finishing the main quest, as each Divine Beast
                 gives Link a special ability and freeing all four beasts reduces the final boss total health by 50%.
          </p>
          <p>Perhaps my favorite feature of the main storyline is the location of the Divine Beasts.
                 Spread out across the four corners of Hyrule, completing the main quest is also an 
                 opportunity to see the beautiful world this game has to offer. Each Divine Beast is host to its own 
                 culture and region, introducing you the player to well-written characters and the core of this game - 
                 the charm. The interaction between Link and the characters in the story are full of life, humor, 
                 credible background and relentless optimism. It's just as enjoyable experiencing it on my fourth playthrough 
                 as it was on my first.
          </p>
          <p>The combination of the fresh, engaging characters and storyline along with not-indecent boss
                 challenges and some of the trickier puzzles in the game are what ranks this storyline so high.
          </p>

          <h2 id="botw-criteria">Side Quests: 10/10</h2>
          <p>What lands this game in my all-time favorites list is the side quests of this game. It's what pulls me back to 
                 this game so often. It's also what I believe gives the game the longevity it has; it continues to be a fan 
                 favorite amongst the Legend of Zelda player base.
